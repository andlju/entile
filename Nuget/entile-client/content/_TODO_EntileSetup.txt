Thank you for adding Entile Notification Framework for Windows Phone 7

There are a few steps left to get everything up and running on the client side:

EntileSettings.xaml
===================
This is where you setup the link between the client and server. You also need to provide
a channel name for your application and you can decide which features to enable.

App.xaml
========
In App.xaml, you need to merge with the ResourceDictionary EntileSettings.xaml:

    <Application.Resources>
        <ResourceDictionary>
            <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
                <ResourceDictionary Source="EntileSettings.xaml"/>
            </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
        </ResourceDictionary>
    </Application.Resources>

EntileView.xaml
===============
For simple scenarios, the default settings may be enough, if that is the case you can
add this view somewhere in your application, perhaps on a settings screen?

Feel free to customize the view, or replace it with something completely different. You 
are in no way required to keep the Entile logo or link, but if you do or if you otherwise
attribute the Entile Framework I would be very grateful!
