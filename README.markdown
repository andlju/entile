Entile
======
The Entile Notification Framework for Windows Phone 7 is a client and server-side library
that intends to make it easier for a developer to create Live Tiles and Toast notifications
when working with Windows Phone 7. 

The most up-to-date information can be found at:

TODO
----
There are many things that remain to be done, a few of them listed here:

 - More and better examples
 - Tests for the server
 - Allow a running client to subscribe to Raw/Toast messages
 - Allow for client-only Live Tile-updates (should be possible to do?)
 - Reschedule notifications that were not received by the client
