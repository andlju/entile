Thank you for adding Entile Notification Framework for Windows Phone 7

There are two steps left to get everything up and running on the server side:

App_Start\Entile.cs
================
All Entile modules are registered in App_Start\EntileStartup.cs. There is a Sample module installed, but it won't be fully
functional until you change the host name.

    public class Entile
    {
        public static void Start()
        {
            // TODO Change the host name (and probably register other modules)
            EntileHost.RegisterModule(new SampleModule("http://localhost:1234"));
        }
    }

SampleService.cs
================
If you want the sample service to be able to send a tile, you also need to change the host
name in the method called "SendSampleTileToAllClients()".


NOTE
====
If this is an ASP.NET MVC application, you will need to follow the instructions in the FAQ to get your routes setup properly:
